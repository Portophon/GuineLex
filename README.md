GuineLex is an online corpus of the lexicon and phonology of the native languages of Guinea-Bissau and Guinea-Bissau Kriyol. This repository assembles a total of 207 words per language, corresponding to Swadesh list items (Swadesh 1955). These items are considered more universal across languages and more frequent within each particular language and it is a typical basis for phonological, lexical, and genealogical studies. The database includes a broad phonetic transcription of aligned items across languages, as well as Portuguese, English, and Kriyol orthography. Databases like this are  also instrumental in language documentation and conservation.
